# Pet Creation Fix - Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed
The pet creation functionality was failing because the API service was using the `supabaseAdmin` client (service role) which bypasses RLS policies, but our database policies were checking for `auth.uid()` which is null when using the service role.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added missing RLS policies** for pets table:
   - `Admin users can create pets` (INSERT)
   - `Admin users can update pets` (UPDATE) 
   - `Admin users can delete pets` (DELETE)

2. **Updated API service** to use authenticated client:
   - Changed `supabaseAdmin` to `supabase` for all pet operations
   - This ensures RLS policies work with authenticated user context

## Files Modified
- `database-modifications.sql` - Added missing RLS policies
- `src/services/api.ts` - Updated pet operations to use authenticated client
- Applied database changes via Supabase Management API

## Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Database Policies
The following policies were added and applied:
```sql
-- Allow admins to create pets
CREATE POLICY "Admin users can create pets" ON pets
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM admin_users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_active = true
        )
    );

-- Allow admins to update pets  
CREATE POLICY "Admin users can update pets" ON pets
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM admin_users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_active = true
        )
    );

-- Allow admins to delete pets (soft delete)
CREATE POLICY "Admin users can delete pets" ON pets
    FOR DELETE USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM admin_users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_active = true
        )
    );
```

### 2. Test Pet Creation
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/pets
2. Click "Add Pet" button
3. Fill out the form:
   - Pet Name: Test Pet
   - Pet Type: Dog or Cat
   - Gender: Male or Female
   - Owner: Select from dropdown
4. Click "Add Pet"
5. Verify success message appears
6. Verify pet appears in the pets list

### 3. Test Pet Updates
1. Click edit button on any pet
2. Modify the pet details
3. Save changes
4. Verify success message and updated data

### 4. Test Pet Deletion
1. Click delete button on any pet
2. Confirm deletion in dialog
3. Verify pet is soft deleted (marked as inactive)

## Expected Results
- ✅ Pet creation should work without errors
- ✅ Success toast notifications should appear
- ✅ Pets should appear in the list immediately after creation
- ✅ Form validation should work properly
- ✅ Owner selection should load available users
- ✅ All CRUD operations should work seamlessly

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify admin user is properly authenticated
3. Check network tab for API request/response details
4. Ensure Supabase environment variables are correct
